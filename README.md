2. Set up the MySQL database:

- Start your MySQL server (depends on your installation, e.g., sudo service mysql start or mysql.server start).
- Create a database for the project.

Visit http://localhost:3000 (or whichever port you've set) in your browser to see the website in action.

## Security

We take security seriously. To protect your application from common exploits:

- Always use secure connections over HTTPS.
- Ensure all dependencies are always up-to-date and no security vulnerabilities are present.
- Store all sensitive data (like database passwords) securely, e.g., using environment variables.
